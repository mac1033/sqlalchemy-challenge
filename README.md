## Analyze and Explore Climate Data
Using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database.(Honolulu, Hawaii)

## Precipitation Analysis
- Designing a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

- Selecting only the date and prcp values.

- Loading the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

- Plotting the results using the DataFrame plot method.

- Using Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

## Station Analysis
- Designing a query to calculate the total number of stations.

- Designing a query to find the most active stations.

- Designing a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

## Climate App
- A dictionary using date as the key and prcp as the value.

- A list of stations from the dataset.

- The dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.

- List of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for all dates greater than and equal to the given date.
